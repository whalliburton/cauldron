SSH-COMMAND is really useful for monitoring the activity on a bunch of
systems. 

What you have to do first though is set up SSH to not require
passwords. This requires two things, setting up your local X server to
run inside a ssh-agent and copying your public keys over to the remote
systems.


The first step is done by having the ~/.xinitrc file read as such:

  exec /usr/bin/ssh-agent /lisp/projects/spaceship/spaceship

and executing 'ssh-add' from the shell once X has started.


The second step is done by copying the local

  ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

over to the remote system and renaming it 

  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys2


TODO. Add in how to create the id_rsa.pub.


Once this is all set up things like 

SPACESHIP> (ssh-command "w" '("12.34.56.78" "23.45.78.89"))

work like a charm.
